# Disease Prediction Using AI

This project is a web-based application that leverages machine learning models to predict various diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, lung cancer, and hypo-thyroid. The application is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to input their health data and receive predictions.

## Features

### Disease Prediction
The application supports predictions for the following diseases:
- **Diabetes**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Parkinson's Disease**
- **Lung Cancer**
- **Hypo-Thyroid**

### Interactive UI
- Developed using **Streamlit** for a seamless and user-friendly experience.
- Simple and intuitive layout for easy navigation.

### Background Customization
- Includes a **custom background image** to enhance aesthetics.

### Pre-trained Models
- Utilizes **pre-trained machine learning models** for accurate disease predictions.
- Ensures quick and efficient processing of user input data.
